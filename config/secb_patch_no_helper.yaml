      Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are resolved?
      Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the code repository to ensure the crash points specified in the <issue_description> are not triggered.
      Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

      1. EXPLORATION: First, thoroughly explore the repository structure using tools like `find` and `grep`.
        - Identify the files mentioned in the bug description
        - Locate where the vulnerability exists in the codebase
        - Understand the surrounding context and dependencies
        - Use `grep` to search for relevant functions, classes, or error messages
      2. ANALYSIS: Based on your exploration, think carefully about the security vulnerability and propose 2-3 possible approaches to fix it.
        - Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability
        - Consider trade-offs between different solutions
        - Select the most promising approach and explain your reasoning
      3. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.
        - Make minimal, focused changes to fix the vulnerability
        - Ensure your changes do not introduce new security issues
      4. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.
        - Build the project and check for compilation errors
        - If compilation succeeds, verify the fix prevents the crash by running a command to trigger the sanitizer error
        - If the fix fails, revise your implementation until the crash is prevented
      5. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the bug description and review your changes.
        - Ensure you've fully addressed the security vulnerability
        - Confirm the fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue
        - Verify no unintended side effects are introduced

      Be thorough in your exploration, analysis, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.
